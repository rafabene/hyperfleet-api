## 1. Introduction

The HyperFleet API is the **central data layer** within the HyperFleet system. As a stateless REST service, it stores resource specifications and aggregates status reported from distributed adapters. The API exposes REST endpoints for creating and managing resources, while serving as the **source of truth** that Sentinel and adapters poll for resource state.

**IMPORTANT:** The HyperFleet API is a **mandatory core component**. You cannot run HyperFleet without it. Deploy the API before deploying Sentinel, adapters.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Stateless design** - Horizontal scaling without coordination overhead
- **Provider-agnostic specs** - Store resource (e.g., cluster, nodepool) configurations independent of infrastructure provider
- **Status aggregation** - Unified resource status computed from distributed adapter reports
- **Generation tracking** - Coordinate spec changes across distributed adapters to ensure eventual consistency
- **Pure data layer** - No business logic or event generation—separation of concerns enables simpler operations

**Core Responsibilities:**

1. **CRUD operations** for resources (cluster, nodepool) with provider-agnostic specifications
2. **Status aggregation** from multiple adapters into unified resource conditions
3. **Generation tracking** to coordinate spec changes across distributed adapters
4. **Resource lifecycle management** with referential integrity between parent and child resources

The API does **not** contain business logic or event generation—those responsibilities belong to separate controllers (Sentinel, adapters). This separation enables horizontal scaling and simplifies the deployment model.

## 2. Concepts

### 2.1 Resource Model

The API stores and manages resources using a consistent data model. Understanding this model is essential for working with the API.

#### 2.1.1 Core Resource Structure

Every resource (cluster, nodepool) has these key fields:

```
Resource (e.g., Cluster)
├── id                    (36-character UUID v7 identifier, auto-generated)
├── kind                  (Resource "Cluster" or "NodePool")
├── name                  (Unique identifier)
├── spec                  (JSONB - desired state, provider-specific)
├── labels                (Key-value metadata for filtering)
├── generation            (Version counter, auto-incremented on spec changes)
├── status
│   └── conditions[]      (Aggregated state)
├── created_time
├── updated_time
├── created_by
└── updated_by
```

**Field Details:**

| Field | Type | Purpose | Managed By |
|-------|------|---------|------------|
| **spec** | JSONB | Desired state - what you want the resource to look like | User (via API) |
| **status** | JSONB | Observed state - what adapters report about the resource | API (aggregated from adapter reports) |
| **generation** | int32 | Version counter that increments when spec changes | API (automatic) |
| **labels** | key-value pairs | Key-value pairs for filtering and organization (stored in `resource_labels` table) | User (via API) |

**How the Resource Model Works:**

1. **Desired State (spec)**: When you create or update a resource, you provide a `spec` containing the desired configuration (e.g., cluster region, version, node count). The API stores this without business-logic interpretation, but validates it against the OpenAPI schema when a schema is configured.

2. **Automatic Version Tracking (generation)**: Every time you update the `spec`, the API automatically increments the `generation` counter. This allows distributed adapters to detect when they need to reconcile infrastructure changes.

3. **Observed State (status)**: Adapters report their progress and results back to the API via status endpoints. The API aggregates these reports into unified resource-level conditions (`Reconciled`, `LastKnownReconciled`, and `Ready` — which is a deprecated alias of `Reconciled`).

4. **Filtering (labels)**: Labels are key-value pairs you can attach to resources for organization and filtering (e.g., `environment: production`, `region: us-east-1`). E.g., Sentinel instances can define resource selectors based on labels to watch specific subsets of resources, enabling horizontal scaling across multiple Sentinel deployments.

<summary><b>Resource Lifecycle Example</b> (click to expand)</summary>

The following example uses a cluster resource, but all resource types (clusters, nodepools) follow the same lifecycle pattern:

```bash
# 1. User creates cluster
POST /api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters
{
  "name": "my-cluster",
  "spec": {"region": "us-east-1", "version": "4.14"},
  "labels": {"environment": "production"}
}

→ API stores:
  - generation: 1 (initial)
  - status: {conditions: []} (empty, no adapter reports yet)

# 2. View cluster status
GET /api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters/{id}
{
  "id": "019466a0-8f8e-7abc-9def-0123456789ab",
  "kind": "Cluster",
  "name": "my-cluster",
  "generation": 1,
  "spec": {
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "version": "4.14"
  },
  "labels": {
    "environment": "production"
  },
  "status": {
    "conditions": [
      {
        "type": "Reconciled",
        "status": "True",
        "observed_generation": 1,
        "last_transition_time": "2026-03-10T07:56:35Z"
      },
      {
        "type": "LastKnownReconciled",
        "status": "True",
        "observed_generation": 1,
        "last_transition_time": "2026-03-10T07:56:35Z"
      },
      {
        "type": "Ready",
        "status": "True",
        "observed_generation": 1,
        "last_transition_time": "2026-03-10T07:56:35Z"
      }
    ]
  },
  "created_time": "2026-03-10T06:03:30Z",
  "updated_time": "2026-03-10T07:56:35Z"
}

→ API returns aggregated status with Reconciled, LastKnownReconciled, and Ready conditions

# 3. View adapter statuses
GET /api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters/{id}/statuses
{
  "items": [
    {
      "adapter": "validation",
      "observed_generation": 1,
      "conditions": [
        {
          "type": "Available",
          "status": "True",
          "reason": "ValidationPassed",
          "message": "Environment validated successfully"
        },
        {
          "type": "Applied",
          "status": "True",
          "reason": "JobApplied",
          "message": "Validation job applied successfully"
        },
        {
          "type": "Health",
          "status": "True",
          "reason": "Healthy",
          "message": "Adapter executed successfully"
        }
      ],
      "last_report_time": "2026-03-10T07:56:05Z"
    },
    {
      "adapter": "dns",
      "observed_generation": 1,
      "conditions": [
        {
          "type": "Available",
          "status": "True",
          "reason": "DnsReady",
          "message": "DNS records created successfully"
        },
        {
          "type": "Applied",
          "status": "True",
          "reason": "RecordsCreated",
          "message": "DNS configuration applied"
        },
        {
          "type": "Health",
          "status": "True",
          "reason": "Healthy",
          "message": "Adapter executed successfully"
        }
      ],
      "last_report_time": "2026-03-10T07:56:05Z"
    }
  ],
  "total": 2
}

→ API returns individual adapter status reports
```

</details>

#### 2.1.2 Resource Hierarchy

The API supports hierarchical resource structures where resources can have parent-child relationships. Currently, clusters can have child nodepools:

```
Cluster
├── spec, status, labels, generation
└── NodePools (children)
    ├── spec, status, labels, generation
    └── owner_references → Parent Cluster
```

**Key aspects:**

- **Nested API paths**: NodePools are created under their parent cluster using `/clusters/{cluster-id}/nodepools`
- **Parent reference**: NodePools store a reference to their parent cluster via the `owner_references` field
- **Same structure**: NodePools have the same field structure as clusters (spec, status, labels, generation)
- **Consistent status model**: NodePool status and adapter statuses work the same way as cluster resources

<details>
<summary><b>NodePool Creation Example</b> (click to expand)</summary>

Create a nodepool belonging to a cluster by specifying the cluster ID in the API path:

```bash
# Create nodepool under a cluster
POST /api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters/{cluster-id}/nodepools
{
  "kind": "NodePool",
  "name": "nodepool-workers",
  "labels": {
    "workload": "gpu",
    "tier": "compute"
  },
  "spec": {
    "replicas": 2,
    "machineType": "n1-standard-8"
  }
}

# View nodepool status (same structure as cluster status)
GET /api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters/{cluster-id}/nodepools/{nodepool-id}

# View nodepool adapter statuses (same structure as cluster adapter statuses)
GET /api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters/{cluster-id}/nodepools/{nodepool-id}/statuses
```

The nodepool resource structure and status aggregation work identically to clusters - the only difference is the API path includes the parent cluster ID.

</details>

### 2.2 Adapter Registration

**How registration works:** You define which adapters are required for each resource type to be marked as `Ready`. Adapters are declared per entity type via the `required_adapters` field in `config.yaml` (or Helm `config.entities`), and the API will not start if this configuration is missing.

Only **registered adapters** participate in status aggregation:

- The `Ready` condition checks if all registered adapters report `Available=True` at the current `resource.spec.generation`
- Unregistered adapters can report status, but don't affect resource readiness
- Changing registered adapters requires an API restart (configuration is read at startup)

**Configuration:**

Required adapters are declared per entity type in the `entities` configuration. Each entity descriptor has a `required_adapters` field:

```yaml
entities:
  - kind: Cluster
    plural: clusters
    required_adapters:  # Example adapter names - adjust to match your deployment
      - validation
      - dns
      - pullsecret
      - hypershift
  - kind: NodePool
    plural: nodepools
    parent_kind: Cluster
    required_adapters:  # Example adapter names - adjust to match your deployment
      - validation
      - hypershift
```

### 2.3 Status Aggregation

HyperFleet API aggregates the condition values reported by adapters associated with a resource and adds three synthetic aggregated conditions.

| Condition | Meaning | When True |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Reconciled** | Resource is fully reconciled at current spec | All registered adapters report `Available=True` at the **current** `resource.spec.generation` |
| **LastKnownReconciled** | Resource is operational at any known good configuration | All registered adapters report `Available=True` for a common `observed_generation`, or sticky-true is preserved when adapters are transitioning to a new generation |
| **Ready** *(deprecated — use Reconciled)* | Alias of Reconciled | Same as Reconciled |

**Note**: The meaning of the field `last_updated_time` for the aggregated conditions has special meaning. It doesn't reflect the last time it was updated from adapters but the OLDEST time it can be considered to be valid.

This is used by other components (Sentinel) to determine how "fresh" the status really is. By using the oldest aggregation signal, the validity of the aggregated condition is as good as the oldest received report from adapters.

##### Resource status conditions

The resource `status.conditions` array contains:

- **Reconciled** - The resource is reconciled to the latest resource spec
  - `True`: All required adapters `conditions[type=Available].status==True` at current spec generation
  - `False`: Any other combination of conditions

- **Ready** *(deprecated — use Reconciled)* - Alias of Reconciled with identical semantics

- **LastKnownReconciled** - The resource is reconciled at a generation of the spec, current or past
  - This condition is stateful meaning that is computed taking into account its previous values of `status` and `observed_generation`
  - This condition is "best effort", since there are cases that can not be covered correctly.
  - `True`:
    - All required adapters `conditions[type=Available].status==True` for the same `observed_generation`
    - Current value `status==True` and required adapters `conditions[type=Available]` at mixed `observed_generation`
  - `False`: Any other combination of conditions
  - e.g. `LastKnownReconciled=True` for `observed_generation==1`
    - One adapter reports `Available=False` for `observed_generation=1` `LastKnownReconciled` transitions to `False`
    - One adapter reports `Available=False` for `observed_generation=2` `LastKnownReconciled` keeps its `True` status

- One **per-adapter** condition for each required adapter that has reported, mirroring the adapter's `conditions[type=Available]`:
  - `type`: Derived from the adapter name — PascalCase with `Successful` suffix (e.g., `adapter1` → `Adapter1Successful`, `my-adapter` → `MyAdapterSuccessful`)
  - `status`: `True` or `False` mirroring the adapter's `Available.status`
  - `reason` / `message`: Copied from the adapter's `Available` condition
  - `observed_generation`: The adapter's `observed_generation`
  - `last_updated_time`: The adapter's `last_report_time`
  - `last_transition_time`: Updated only when the per-adapter status (True/False) changes

- Aggregation is always computed from resource statuses array
- It can be computed at any time, is deterministic
  - This means wall clock should not be involved when assigning time values

These are API examples for a resource and resource statuses:

##### Rules to accept/discard adapter reports

- Useless value
  - Discard if condition Available has status different from True/False/Unknown
  - Discard reports with status Unknown if there is an existing report for the adapter with status True/False
  - Conditions with Unknown status are not used to compute aggregated conditions
  - Discard if condition comes with an invalid `observed_time`
- Generation not yet reached
  - Discard if an adapter report has `observed_generation > resource.generation`
- Older generation than existing for adapter
  - Discard if an adapter report has `observed_generation < statuses[].observed_generation`
- Older observation than existing for adapter at same generation
  - Discard if an adapter report has `observed_time < statuses[].observed_time` (same adapter, same `observed_generation`)

When a resource is created:

- Initial `generation` is 1 and aggregated conditions are evaluated
- `observed_generation` for `Ready` and `LastKnownReconciled` aggregated conditions is 1
- `last_updated_time` and `last_transition_time` for `Ready` and `LastKnownReconciled` aggregated conditions is `resource.last_updated_time`

When a resource is changed:

- `resource.generation` gets incremented and aggregated conditions are re-evaluated
- `status.conditions[type==Ready].observed_generation` always follows `resource.generation`
- `status.conditions[type==LastKnownReconciled].observed_generation` changes when all required adapters `condition[type==Available].observed_generation==resource.generation` otherwise remains unchanged.

##### Computing `observed_generation`

- For `Ready` it always matches `resource.generation`
- For `LastKnownReconciled`:
  - If all required adapters have a common `observed_generation` it will match the common value
  - If required adapters have mixed `observed_generation`
    - If `LastKnownReconciled` is `True`, `observed_generation` remains at its current value
    - If `LastKnownReconciled` is `False`, `observed_generation` will get the value of the `max(condition[type==Available].observed_generation)`

##### Computing `status.conditions[type==Ready].last_updated_time`

The meaning of `last_updated_time` in the aggregated conditions refers to the newest time we can consider the status to be in the current state. This is not the time of the latest report, but the oldest time of the reports.

- If there are no required adapter conditions at `observed_generation==resource.generation` then `last_updated_time=resource.last_updated_time`
  - This means that when no adapters have reported at current `resource.generation`, the API change is the last change
- If all required adapters have `condition[type==Available].observed_generation==resource.generation` then `last_updated_time=min(statuses[].conditions[type==Available].observed_time)`
  - This means that the oldest report from adapters at current generation is considered the oldest time we can consider the `Ready` value to be valid
  - Why do we want to keep the "oldest" value? because if it is too old, we need to trigger a reconciliation
- When some required adapter conditions `condition[type==Available].observed_generation==resource.generation` then `last_updated_time=min(statuses[].conditions[type==Available && observed_generation==resource.generation].observed_time)`

##### Computing `status.conditions[type==LastKnownReconciled].last_updated_time`

- If all required adapters have `condition[type==Available].observed_generation` at the same value then `last_updated_time=min(statuses[].conditions[type==Available].observed_time)`
- If not all required adapters have `condition[type==Available].observed_generation` at the same value:
  - If any adapter at current `observed_generation==X` has `conditions[type==Available].status==False` then `last_updated_time=min(adapters[type==Available && observed_generation==X].observed_time`
- In any other case `last_updated_time` is kept unchanged

##### Computing `last_transition_time` for both `Ready` and `LastKnownReconciled`

- Meaning is last time this condition’s status (True / False) changed, regardless of the existing and new `observed_generation`
- This property is stateful since it relies on the existing value to determine if there has been a transition
- For `Ready` when a `resource.generation` changes, the `last_transition_time` becomes `resource.last_updated_time` if status was `True`

## 3. Configuration Reference

This section highlights the **critical configuration** needed to operate the API.

For comprehensive guides on specific topics:

- **Environment variables**: See [Deployment Guide - Environment Variables](deployment.md#environment-variables)
- **Database setup**: See [Database Guide](database.md)
- **Authentication**: See [Authentication Guide](authentication.md)
- **Helm chart values**: See [Deployment Guide](deployment.md)

### 3.1 Adapter Requirements (REQUIRED)

Each entity type declares its required adapters in the `entities` configuration. **Note:** The adapter names shown below are examples — you must configure them to match the adapters actually deployed in your environment.

```yaml
entities:
  - kind: Cluster
    plural: clusters
    required_adapters:  # Example adapter names - adjust to match your deployment
      - validation
      - dns
      - pullsecret
      - hypershift
  - kind: NodePool
    plural: nodepools
    parent_kind: Cluster
    required_adapters:  # Example adapter names - adjust to match your deployment
      - validation
      - hypershift
```

### 3.2 Database Configuration

The API requires PostgreSQL 13 or later.

**Helm deployment:**

Configure database connection using Helm values:

```yaml
database:
  external:
    enabled: true
    secretName: hyperfleet-db-prod  # Secret containing database credentials
```

The secret must contain these fields:

```
db.host         → PostgreSQL hostname
db.port         → PostgreSQL port
db.name         → Database name
db.user         → Database username
db.password     → Database password
db.rootcert     → (Optional) SSL root certificate
```

**SSL configuration:**

Use the `--db-sslmode` flag when running the binary directly:

```bash
./hyperfleet-api serve --db-sslmode=verify-full
```

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `disable` | No SSL (development only) |
| `require` | SSL required, no cert verification |
| `verify-ca` | Verify server cert against CA |
| `verify-full` | Verify cert and hostname (recommended for production) |

### 3.3 Authentication Configuration

**What is JWT authentication?** JWT (JSON Web Token) is a secure way to verify that API requests come from authorized users or services. In production, the API validates tokens to ensure only authenticated clients can create or modify clusters.

**Helm deployment:**

```yaml
# Development (no authentication)
server:
  jwt:
    enabled: false

# Production (with JWT authentication)
# See "Issuer configuration reference" in docs/authentication.md
server:
  jwt:
    enabled: true
    configs:
      - issuer_url: https://your-idp.example.com/auth/realms/your-realm
        jwk_cert_url: https://your-idp.example.com/auth/realms/your-realm/protocol/openid-connect/certs
```

**Direct binary execution:**

```bash
# Development (no authentication)
./hyperfleet-api serve --server-jwt-enabled=false

# Production (with JWT authentication)
# Configure issuers in a config file
./hyperfleet-api serve --config config.yaml
```

See [Authentication Guide](authentication.md) for detailed JWT setup.

### 3.4 Server Binding

The API runs three independent servers on different ports:

- **API server** (built-in default: `localhost:8000`) - REST endpoints
- **Health server** (built-in default: `localhost:8080`) - Liveness/readiness probes
- **Metrics server** (built-in default: `localhost:9090`) - Prometheus metrics

**Helm deployment:**

The Helm chart overrides the built-in defaults to bind to all interfaces (required for Kubernetes):

```yaml
server:
  bindAddress: ":8000"          # Overrides localhost:8000
  healthBindAddress: ":8080"    # Overrides localhost:8080
  metricsBindAddress: ":9090"   # Overrides localhost:9090
```

**Direct binary execution:**

The built-in defaults (`localhost:*`) bind to loopback only. For production deployments or to make the API accessible from outside the host, bind to all interfaces:

```bash
./hyperfleet-api serve \
  --api-server-bindaddress=:8000 \
  --health-server-bindaddress=:8080 \
  --metrics-server-bindaddress=:9090
```

**Note:** Use `:PORT` format to bind to all interfaces (0.0.0.0), or `localhost:PORT` for local-only binding (127.0.0.1).

### 3.5 Logging Configuration

```bash
LOG_LEVEL=info            # debug | info | warn | error
LOG_FORMAT=json           # json | text
LOG_OUTPUT=stdout         # stdout | stderr
```

Production should use `LOG_LEVEL=info` and `LOG_FORMAT=json` for structured logging.

### 3.6 Schema Validation

The API validates resource `spec` fields (e.g., cluster, nodepool) against an OpenAPI schema when configured. This allows different providers (GCP, AWS, Azure) to enforce different spec structures.

**Configuration:** `server.openapi_schema_path`

- **Environment variable:** `HYPERFLEET_SERVER_OPENAPI_SCHEMA_PATH=/etc/hyperfleet/schemas/openapi.yaml`
- **Config file:** `server.openapi_schema_path: /etc/hyperfleet/schemas/openapi.yaml`
- **Default:** `openapi/openapi.yaml` (provider-agnostic base schema)

**How validation works:**

The API uses a two-step process to validate specs:

1. **Resource type detection** — The validation middleware inspects the request URL path to determine the resource type:
   - Paths containing `/nodepools` → validated as `nodepool`
   - Paths containing `/clusters` → validated as `cluster`

2. **Schema lookup** — The validator maps each resource type to a specific OpenAPI schema component:
   - `cluster` → looks for `ClusterSpec` in the OpenAPI schema's `components.schemas`
   - `nodepool` → looks for `NodePoolSpec` in the OpenAPI schema's `components.schemas`

**Current limitations:**

- Resource types and schema mappings are currently hardcoded for `cluster` and `nodepool`
- Adding new resource types requires code changes in both the validation middleware and the schema validator
- This design may be generalized in the future to support dynamic resource type registration

**Behavior:**

- **Schema configured and valid**: Specs are validated against the OpenAPI schema. Invalid specs return `400 Bad Request`.
- **Schema missing or invalid**: API logs a warning and starts without validation. Specs are stored without schema validation.
- Startup is **non-blocking** — missing or invalid schema files do not prevent API startup

For details on how schemas are imported for code generation and which schema components map to each resource type, see [openapi/README.md](../openapi/README.md) in this repository.

### 3.7 Tenant Enforcement

Tenant enforcement scopes each resource read, list, update, and delete to the caller's tenant. It is **disabled by default** and is a separate concern from JWT authentication.

**Only enable it when the API runs behind the Envoy + Authorino gateway** ([ADR-0020](https://github.com/openshift-hyperfleet/architecture/blob/main/hyperfleet/adrs/0020-envoy-authorino-api-gateway.md)): tenant identity comes from trusted gateway-injected headers, never JWT claims, and the gateway must strip client-supplied tenant headers and block direct routes to the API pod. Without it, clients could forge tenancy.

Enable it under `server.tenant.*` (`HYPERFLEET_SERVER_TENANT_*` for the scalar fields; dimensions are YAML/Helm-values only):

```yaml
server:
  tenant:
    enabled: true
    system_header: X-HyperFleet-System   # value "true" marks system callers (Sentinel, adapters)
    dimensions:
      - header: X-HyperFleet-Org         # trusted gateway-injected header
        key: org                          # tenancy map key
        required: true
      - header: X-HyperFleet-Project
        key: project
        required: false
```

At runtime, once enabled:

- **System callers** (system header value `true`, e.g. Sentinel and adapters) bypass scoping, but may only write `status`/`conditions` (reported through a separate status path). Any other resource mutation — create, update, or delete — from a system identity returns `403 Forbidden`.
- **Tenant-scoped callers** must present the configured dimension headers. A missing required dimension, an invalid value, or zero resolved dimensions is rejected with `403 Forbidden` before any database access.
- **Cross-tenant access** returns `404 Not Found` (not `403`) for reads, updates, and deletes, so a resource's existence is never leaked across tenants.

For the field reference, environment variables, and validation rules see [Configuration Guide - Tenant Enforcement](config.md#tenant-enforcement); for the full trust model see [Tenant isolation](authentication.md#tenant-isolation). Common tenant errors are in [Appendix B: Troubleshooting](#appendix-b-troubleshooting).

### 3.8 Gateway and In-App JWT Modes

The gateway ([ADR-0020](https://github.com/openshift-hyperfleet/architecture/blob/main/hyperfleet/adrs/0020-envoy-authorino-api-gateway.md)) authenticates callers and injects trusted identity/tenant headers; the API's in-app JWT middleware (`server.jwt.enabled`) validates `Bearer` tokens directly. These are independent switches, but not every combination is currently valid.

Two `Authorization` schemes reach the gateway: human operators use `Bearer <oidc-jwt>`, while machine callers (Sentinel, adapters) use `ServiceAccount <k8s-token>`, validated by Kubernetes TokenReview at the gateway. The in-app JWT middleware accepts the `Bearer` scheme **only** — a `ServiceAccount` token presented to the API is rejected with `401 Unauthorized`. This does not block machine callers outright: a Kubernetes service-account JWT presented directly as `Bearer <k8s-token>` (bypassing gateway TokenReview) validates like any other issuer's token — see [Creating a service account token](authentication.md#creating-a-service-account-token). Only the gateway's `ServiceAccount <k8s-token>` scheme itself has no in-app equivalent.

| `server.jwt.enabled` | `server.tenant.enabled` | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `false` | `false` | No auth, no scoping. Local development only (`make run-no-auth`). |
| `true` | `false` | In-app JWT validation, no tenant scoping. `Bearer` callers only — human OIDC or a Kubernetes service-account JWT presented as `Bearer`; the gateway's `ServiceAccount` scheme is not supported. |
| `true` | `true` | Full production posture behind the gateway: JWT validated, requests scoped to gateway-injected tenant headers. `Bearer` callers only; the gateway's `ServiceAccount` scheme is not supported until [HYPERFLEET-1484](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/HYPERFLEET-1484). |
| `false` | `true` | Gateway performs all authentication (including machine `ServiceAccount` callers); the API trusts injected headers and scopes on them. |

A machine caller authenticating with the gateway's `ServiceAccount <k8s-token>` scheme cannot yet traverse the in-app JWT middleware, because it is `Bearer`-only. Until [HYPERFLEET-1484](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/HYPERFLEET-1484) adds `ServiceAccount`-scheme support to the in-app middleware, deployments that must authenticate such callers should keep `server.jwt.enabled: false` and let the gateway authenticate every caller (bottom row above).

#### Mixed dimension cardinality

Within a single deployment, all callers are expected to resolve the same set of tenant dimensions. Mixing callers that resolve different dimension sets (for example, some presenting only `org` and others presenting `org` + `project`) against the same resources is not yet supported — JSONB containment scoping (`tenancy @> caller`) would let a coarser-scoped caller match finer-scoped resources. Support for heterogeneous dimension cardinality is tracked by [HYPERFLEET-1634](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/HYPERFLEET-1634).

## 4. Deployment Checklist

For detailed Helm commands and configuration, see the [Deployment Guide](deployment.md).

Follow this checklist to ensure successful API deployment and operation.

### Phase 1: Database Preparation

Choose your database deployment strategy based on your environment:

**Option A: Development (Built-in PostgreSQL)**

- [ ] Skip database provisioning - built-in PostgreSQL will be created automatically
- [ ] **Note:** Built-in PostgreSQL is **not suitable for production** (single replica, no backups)

**Option B: Production (External Database)**

- [ ] Ensure PostgreSQL 13+ database server is running and accessible from Kubernetes cluster
- [ ] Create database and user with appropriate permissions:

  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE hyperfleet;
  CREATE USER hyperfleet WITH PASSWORD '<strong-password>';
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE hyperfleet TO hyperfleet;
  GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO hyperfleet;
  ```

- [ ] Create Kubernetes secret with database credentials:

  ```bash
  kubectl create secret generic hyperfleet-db \
    --namespace hyperfleet-system \
    --from-literal=db.host=postgres.example.com \
    --from-literal=db.port=5432 \
    --from-literal=db.name=hyperfleet \
    --from-literal=db.user=hyperfleet \
    --from-literal=db.password=<strong-password>
  ```

- [ ] Verify secret was created correctly:

  ```bash
  kubectl get secret hyperfleet-db -n hyperfleet-system -o json | jq '.data | keys'
  ```

  Expected output: `["db.host", "db.name", "db.password", "db.port", "db.user"]`

- [ ] Test database connectivity:

  ```bash
  kubectl run pg-debug --rm -it --image=postgres:15-alpine \
    --restart=Never -n hyperfleet-system -- \
    psql -h <db-host> -U hyperfleet -d hyperfleet -c "SELECT 1"
  ```

  Expected output: `?column? | 1`

### Phase 2: Configuration Planning

**Define Adapter Requirements**

- [ ] List required adapters for each resource type (see [Adapter Registration](#22-adapter-registration))
  - **Example** cluster adapters: `cluster-validation`, `dns`, `pullsecret`, `hypershift`
  - **Example** nodepool adapters: `nodepool-validation`, `hypershift`
  - **Note:** These are example adapter names - configure to match your actual deployment
- [ ] Confirm all adapters are deployed or will be deployed alongside the API

**Prepare Helm Values File**

- [ ] Create `custom-values.yaml` based on your requirements
- [ ] Review and adjust configuration:
  - Adapter lists match your deployment
  - Database secret name matches (if using external database)
  - Resource limits appropriate for your cluster size
  - Authentication settings match your requirements

### Phase 3: Deployment

**Install HyperFleet API**

- [ ] Deploy using Helm:

  ```bash
  helm install hyperfleet-api oci://quay.io/redhat-services-prod/hyperfleet-tenant/hyperfleet/hyperfleet-api-chart:<tag> \
    --namespace hyperfleet-system \
    --create-namespace \
    --values custom-values.yaml
  ```

- [ ] Verify deployment was created:

  ```bash
  kubectl get deployment -n hyperfleet-system hyperfleet-api
  ```

- [ ] Wait for pods to be ready:

  ```bash
  kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pod -l app=hyperfleet-api -n hyperfleet-system --timeout=300s
  ```

**Verify Database Migration**

- [ ] Check init container logs to confirm migration completed:

  ```bash
  kubectl logs -n hyperfleet-system <pod-name> -c db-migrate
  ```

  Expected output: `Migration completed successfully`

- [ ] Verify database tables were created:

  ```bash
  kubectl run pg-debug --rm -it --image=postgres:15-alpine \
    --restart=Never -n hyperfleet-system -- \
    psql -h <db-host> -U hyperfleet -d hyperfleet -c "\dt"
  ```

  Expected tables: `adapter_statuses`, `resources`, `resource_conditions`, `resource_labels`, `resource_references`

### Phase 4: Post-Deployment Validation

**Verify Service Health**

- [ ] Check health endpoint: `curl http://<hyperfleet-api-service>:8080/healthz`
- [ ] Check readiness endpoint: `curl http://<hyperfleet-api-service>:8080/readyz`
  - Expected: `{"status": "ok"}` for both endpoints
- [ ] Review pod logs for startup errors:

  ```bash
  kubectl logs -n hyperfleet-system -l app=hyperfleet-api
  ```

<details>
<summary><b>Run Smoke Tests (Optional)</b></summary>

- [ ] Create a test cluster:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://<hyperfleet-api-service>:8000/api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "kind": "Cluster",
      "name": "test-cluster",
      "spec": {},
      "labels": {"environment": "test"}
    }'
  ```

  Expected: `201 Created` with cluster object including `id` and `generation: 1`

- [ ] Save cluster ID and retrieve the cluster:

  ```bash
  CLUSTER_ID=<id-from-response>
  curl http://<hyperfleet-api-service>:8000/api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters/$CLUSTER_ID
  ```

  Expected: `200 OK` with cluster object

</details>

## Appendix A: API Integration

This section covers how to integrate with the HyperFleet API, both as a **consumer** (creating/managing clusters) and as an **adapter developer** (reporting status).

For detailed documentation on specific integration topics:

- **API endpoints and request/response formats**: See [API Resources](api-resources.md)
- **Authentication setup**: See [Authentication Guide](authentication.md)
- **Metrics and monitoring**: See [Metrics Documentation](metrics.md)

### For API Consumers

#### Authentication

**Development (no auth):**

If `server.jwt.enabled=false`, no authentication is required:

```bash
curl http://api-host:8000/api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters
```

**Production (JWT authentication):**

Make authenticated requests with a JWT token:

```bash
# Make authenticated request
curl http://api-host:8000/api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN"
```

For details on JWT setup, see [Authentication Guide](authentication.md).

#### Rate Limiting Considerations

The API does not currently enforce rate limits, but clients should implement:

- **Exponential backoff** on retries (5xx errors, conflicts)
- **Polling intervals** of at least 5-10 seconds for status checks

### For Adapter Developers

Adapters are worker components that perform specific tasks (e.g., validation, DNS setup, infrastructure provisioning) and report their status back to the API.

#### Reporting Status Requirements

Every adapter status report must include:

- **adapter** (string) — Must match a value in the entity's `required_adapters` list (configured in the `entities` section of `config.yaml`)
- **observed_generation** (integer) — The generation the adapter processed
- **observed_time** (RFC3339 timestamp) — When the adapter completed its work
- **conditions** (array) — Exactly three condition types:
  - `Available` — Is the work complete and operational?
  - `Applied` — Were Kubernetes resources created/configured?
  - `Health` — Did the adapter execute without errors?

**Optional field:**

- **data** (JSONB) — Optional adapter-specific information for debugging or operational dashboards:
  - Not used in status aggregation (API only reads `conditions`)
  - Can contain any valid JSON structure
  - Persisted in `adapter_statuses.data` column

<details>
<summary><b>Status Report Example</b></summary>

```json
{
  "adapter": "validation",
  "observed_generation": 5,
  "observed_time": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",

      "message": "Validation job created in namespace validation-system"
    },
    {
      "type": "Health",
      "status": "True",
      "reason": "ExecutionSucceeded",
      "message": "Adapter executed without errors"
    }
  ],
  "data": {
    "job_name": "validation-abc123",
    "validation_results": {
      "checks_passed": 15,
      "checks_failed": 0
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

#### Endpoint URLs

**Cluster status:**

```
PUT /api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters/{cluster_id}/statuses
```

**NodePool status:**

```
PUT /api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters/{cluster_id}/nodepools/{nodepool_id}/statuses
```

This section provides a **quick reference** for common API-specific issues and their solutions.

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|---------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **API won't start: missing required adapter configuration** | Entity descriptors not configured | Verify Helm values: `helm get values hyperfleet-api -n hyperfleet-system`. If missing, configure entity descriptors with `required_adapters` in your Helm values file (see [Adapter Requirements](#31-adapter-requirements-required)) and upgrade the release. |
| **Adapters report status but resource remains `Ready=False`** | Adapter name mismatch, missing conditions, or generation mismatch | Check adapter names match registration in entity descriptors (`config.entities[].required_adapters`). Compare with `curl http://<api-service>:8000/api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters/$CLUSTER_ID/statuses`. Verify all conditions present: `curl ... \| jq '.items[] \| {adapter, conditions: [.conditions[].type]}'`. Check generation: `curl -s ... \| jq ".items[] \| {adapter, observed_generation}"`. |
| **Pods stuck in init phase, migration fails: `permission denied for schema public`** | Database user lacks schema permissions | Grant permissions: `GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO hyperfleet; GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO hyperfleet;`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Pods stuck in init phase: `database does not exist`** | Database not created | Create database: `CREATE DATABASE hyperfleet;`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Pods stuck in init phase: `connection timeout`** | Database connection retry settings too low | Increase database connection retry settings using `--db-conn-retry-attempts` and `--db-conn-retry-interval` flags in the init container command                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **High API latency, slow responses** | Resource limits, database slow queries, or connection pool exhausted | Check metrics: `curl http://<api-service>:9090/metrics \| grep hyperfleet_api_request_duration_seconds`. Check resources: `kubectl top pods -n hyperfleet-system`. Check slow queries: `kubectl logs -n hyperfleet-system deployment/hyperfleet-api \| grep "slow query"`. Resolution: Increase resource limits/replicas, add database indexes, or increase `--db-max-open-connections` (default: 50).                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **400 Bad Request** | Resource spec doesn't match OpenAPI schema | Check the loaded schema path: `kubectl logs -n hyperfleet-system deployment/hyperfleet-api \| grep "schema_path"`. Retrieve and inspect the schema: `kubectl exec -n hyperfleet-system deployment/hyperfleet-api -- cat $HYPERFLEET_SERVER_OPENAPI_SCHEMA_PATH`. Validate and fix spec. |
| **401 Unauthorized** | Missing or invalid JWT token | Verify authentication is enabled (`server.jwt.enabled=true`). If production, ensure valid JWT token is provided. Reference: [Authentication Guide](authentication.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **403 Forbidden** | Tenant enforcement rejected the caller: missing/empty required dimension header, invalid dimension value, zero resolved dimensions, or a system identity attempting a resource create/update | Confirm the gateway (Envoy + Authorino) is injecting the configured dimension headers and the system header. Check config: `kubectl get configmap <release>-config -o yaml \| grep -A6 tenant`. Verify each `required: true` dimension header is present and its value matches `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$` (max 63 chars). A system caller's request must carry the configured system header (`server.tenant.system_header`, e.g. `X-HyperFleet-System`) with the value `true`; system callers may only write status/conditions. See [Tenant isolation](authentication.md#tenant-isolation). |
| **404 Not Found** | Resource doesn't exist, or (with tenant enforcement enabled) the resource belongs to a different tenant | Verify resource ID is correct. Check if resource was deleted: `curl http://<api-service>:8000/api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters/$CLUSTER_ID`. If tenant enforcement is enabled, confirm the caller's dimension headers scope to the resource's tenancy — cross-tenant resources return 404 by design.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
